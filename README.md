# 🐍 Monty Interpreter
Welcome to the Monty Bytecode Interpreter. This interpreter was built in the C language and is compliant with ISO90, ISO99, & ISO11. It reads Monty bytecode files of any extension (preferably .m although it doesn't matter), and interprets the opcodes contained.

Our interpreter can be run as either a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO). Mode can be switched mid-script. The interpreter can handle a variety of Monty opcodes, including printing, mathematical operations, and more - all handled opcodes are listed below.

# 🏃 Getting Started
    Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - Operating system reqd.

    GCC 4.8.4 - Compiler used

# ⚠️ Prerequisites
    • Must have git installed.

    • Must have repository cloned.

    $ sudo apt-get install git

# ⬇️ Installing and Using

Clone the repository into a new directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/BennettDixon/monty.git

Compile with the following:

    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty

Run the interpreter on a file:

    ./monty file.m

# 🔧 Monty Opcodes

• push

    ° Usage: push <int>
    ° Pushes an element to the stack.
    ° The parameter <int> must be an integer.

• pall

    ° Prints all values in the stack/queue, starting from the top.

• pint

    ° Prints the top value of the stack/queue.

• pop

    ° Removes the top element of the stack/queue.

• swap

    ° Swaps the top two elements of the stack/queue.

• nop

    ° Does not do anything.

• add

    ° Adds the top two elements of the stack/queue.

    ° The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is popped.

• sub

    ° Subtracts the top element of the stack/queue from the second element from the top.

    ° The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

• mul

    ° Multiplies the top two elements of the stack/queue.

    ° The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

• div

    ° Divides the second element from the top of the stack/queue by the top element.

    ° The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

• mod

    ° Computes the modulus of the second element from the top of the stack/queue divided by the top element.

    ° The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.

• pchar

    ° Prints the character value of the top element of the stack/queue.

    ° The integer at the top is treated as an ASCII value.

• pstr

    ° Prints the string contained in the stack/queue.

    ° Prints characters element by element until the stack/queue is empty, a value is 0, or an error occurs.

• rotl

    ° Rotates the top element of the stack/queue to the bottom.

• rotr

    ° Rotates the bottom element of the stack/queue to the top.

• stack

    ° Switches a queue to stack mode.

• queue

    ° Switches a stack to queue mode.

▶️ Opcodes preceeded by a # are treated as comments and the corresponding line is ignored.

▶️ Lines can be empty and can contain any number of spaces before or after an opcode and its argument (only the first opcode and/or argument is taken into account).

# 📋 Examples

Note, Monty Interpreter runs in the default mode of STACK mode. Meaning it uses a stack. To switch to queue mode, see examples below.

Push values onto the stack and print them all, or the top of the stack/front of queue.

$ cat push_pall_pint.m

push 1

push 2

push 3

pall

pint

$ ./monty push_pall_pint.m

3

3

Using mathmatical operations to add, multiply, divide, etc. Takes the second from the top and performs the operation on the top: second_from_top / top, second_from_top - top, etc. Then assigns that to the second_from_top and pops the top element off the stack.

$ cat math.m

push 3

push 2

push 1

pall

mul

pall

$ ./monty math.m

1

6

Entering queue mode to perform all operations in FIFO (queue) mode instead of default LIFO (stack) mode. Note: does not change current stack, sets front of queue to top of stack.

$ cat queue.m

queue

push 1

push 2

push 3

pall

stack

push 4

push 5

push 6

pall

$ ./monty queue.m
